## Advanced Stack Technology üñºÔ∏è  
![JPEN](https://kidKrishkode.github.io/Streamline-Diagnosis.github.io/images/jpen.png)  
The JPEN stack is a technology stack that combines the power of JSON, Python, Embedded JavaScript, and Node.js. JSON (J) is used for level data interchange and storage, providing a lightweight and flexible format for data exchange. Python (P) is used for mechine learning scripting, offering a robust and versatile language for building machine learning empower web applications. Embedded JavaScript (E) allows for dynamic client-side scripting, enabling interactive user experiences. Finally, Node.js (N) provides the runtime environment for executing JavaScript code on the server-side, enabling fast and scalable web development. Together, the JPEN stack enables developers to build scalable, and data driven or deep learning combined web applications.
